#Process Monitor & Performance Analyzer
This project provides real-time process monitoring, risk assessment, and performance optimization using machine learning techniques. It logs system resource usage, detects potential bottlenecks, and generates interactive reports to help analyze CPU and memory consumption trends.

#📌 Features
✅ Real-time process monitoring: Tracks active processes and logs CPU & memory usage every few seconds.
✅ Machine learning-based risk analysis: Uses a RandomForest model to classify process status as NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL.
✅ Automated reports: Generates text-based and graphical performance reports for easy analysis.
✅ Interactive CPU & Memory usage charts: View real-time trends through a web-based visualization.
✅ Optimization recommendations: Suggests possible performance optimizations based on critical processes.

#🚀 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn plotly

2️⃣ Running the Monitoring Script
Execute the real-time process monitoring script:
python monitor.py

3️⃣ View Reports & Analysis
Performance Summary: Open performance_report.txt to review identified bottlenecks.

Interactive Chart: Open cpu_usage.html in a web browser to analyze CPU & memory trends visually.

Raw Logs: View process_logs.csv for detailed process usage data.

#📊 How It Works
Process Monitoring (PowerShell Script)

Collects process details (Process Name, CPU Usage, Memory Usage).

Logs data in process_logs.csv every few seconds.

Classifies processes as NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL.

Data Analysis (Python Script)

Reads process_logs.csv and processes the data.

Trains a RandomForestClassifier to predict process risk levels.

Generates performance reports (performance_report.txt and cpu_usage.html).

Provides optimization recommendations for critical processes.

#📌 Example Output
Performance Report (performance_report.txt)
=== Performance Report ===
Generated: 2025-03-28 14:30:15

Critical Processes:
ProcessName    CPU   Memory
chrome.exe     32.5   750.2
python.exe     45.3   620.1

Recommendations:
chrome.exe: Reduce tab usage, Enable hardware acceleration, Disable unnecessary extensions
python.exe: Optimize script logic, Reduce memory-intensive operations, Use multiprocessing

#Graphical Report (cpu_usage.html)
✅ Displays CPU & Memory usage trends over time.
✅ Interactive filters to focus on specific processes.
✅ Helps visualize performance bottlenecks.
